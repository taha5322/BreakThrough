# BreakThrough
Breakthrough is a mental health counseling app that I developed for a hackathon. There are many different parts of the app which are listed on the home screen on the first image. Key features to mention are the **"chatroom"** feature which allow two users with the app to message each other(this actually works). The logic for this feature was to match therapists to people who are in need of mental health assistance. Additionally, the **"daily check-in"** allows the user to input their current mood and the algorithm sort of gives encouragement along with other things based on the response. Additionally, the mood for every single day is recorded and graphed which is then outputted to the user at the end of the month using the **"tracker"** feature.<br>
Finally, the **"Educate Yourself"** feature is there to educate people about the effects of mental health and the **"Explore Content"** feature is there to help people who are currently suffering by showing them more peaceful content like yoga tutorials, meditation videos, etc.
